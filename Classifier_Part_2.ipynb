    "\n",
    "Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) are apart of a greater class of learning called \"Deep Learning\". Deep learning is a type of learning, or computational model more specificially, that invloves creating what is known as an artifical neural network (ANN). An ANN is pretty much a bunch of perceptrons stringed together by weights. A perceptron is meant to abstractly mimic a neuron in the brain (which has action potiental and only fires when it passes a threshold) and only fires if the weights and values sent to it combine to pass a threshold. In our case this creates the unique oppurtunity where the perceptrons can work as a system to guess at what the input image was and make guess at what class that image belongs to. This takes the approach of trail and error and learning, versus just searching all possible search spaces. This gives it the ability to guess quickly and slowly correct itself as it tries to guess the right image and will slowly \"learn\". There is obviously much more to NN, but it is a facinating bridge between computer science and cognitive science. What makes a CNN important to a classifier, is a CNN has an added special ability to recognize patterns, which makes it quite useful for pattern recognition in photos. This area has important implications in computer vision. It can allow automatic detection of objects in photographs making it useful for real life object detection and searching efforts when there is no human to make the judgement call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation**\n",
    "\n",
    "My interest in this space is really what drove me to where I am now here at MSU. This idea that we can create machines/programs that can learn the enviroment is really quite fascinating. The fact we can create things that are artifically intelligent and could almost seem conscious is really one of the most bizzare things out there. That fascination has led me to learning Data Science and becoming interested in Cognitive Science and all the ways we can use computation to accomplish the feats that at one time only seemed a human could do. Quite honestly, this field of study has fundamentally changed the way I look at life, and studying CNN and PyTorch just seems like a natural extension of my fascinations now.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Computation in Convolution Neural Networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for a Convolutional Neural Network to work and learn, there is a ton of computation and calculations that need to be done. An ANN is really just a bunch of linear algebra that can spit out a result. The base of the NN is just a bunch of perceptrons, that are really just functions that take in a bunch of signals and add them together. These functions can be many things like a sigmoid function, or RELU, etc. The function acts acts as a way the perceptron can pass or not pass its signal on to the next perceptron. It is this activation and signal passing that takes an input and displays an output. This is just merely the guess of the NN. The learning comes from what is known as the \"forward\" and \"backward\" algorithm. Again just fancy linear algebra, that adjusts the weights of the NN to change the strength of signals between perceptrons. So with all calculations comes computation. This computation, however, is parallelizable as often most of the calculations can be teased apart and easily mapped to a GPU. Since a GPU is just a bunch of very tiny cores, it is perfect to perform a bunch of very simple calculations and summing. In the case of the of our CNN, the image will be teased apart into pixels, some transformations will happen, and then each pixel will be mapped to an ANN that will calcuate with every single perceptron the classification of the image.\n",

The way this code will be optimized is by allowing the code to run on more than 1 GPU. It should be noted that originally the code came in a serial version. I then transformed it into the GPU verison that is in `pytorch_classifier/`. However, the serial version will not be fully tested as it would take an extremely long time to test the code.

    "\n",
    "The CNN classifier is created using a basic CNN structure and the CNN is trained and tested on the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cifar10). The code for this comes directly from PyTorch's website tutorials [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-cifar10-tutorial-py). The code provided is serial utilizing only a CPU. My task was to parallelize first with GPU support and then parallelize with mutliple GPU support. Fortuntely with pytorch this is a pretty painless process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run the code, it is advised to visit [`./pytorch_classifier/README.md`](./pytorch_classifier/README.md). In that README file you will find everything that is needed to setup an enviroment on the HPCC that can run this python code. In sort, the README file will tell you how to install Anaconda 3 with python 3.8 on the HPCC, walk you through how to set up the appropiate enviroment using `.yml` file, and make sure you can activate the `pytorch_classifier` enviroment. This will be imperative to getting any of the following code working.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made many modifications to make this code easy to work with my submission script, but I will go over the main modifications I made to the original code to Parallalelize it with single GPU and then mutli GPU support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single GPU Parallelize\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning of the code (Part 1 of Tutorial) I added the following line\n",
    "```python\n",
    "device = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This allows PyTorch to check if a GPU is avaliable, and if not it will set this device varaible to CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then after defining the network as a class called `Net` (Part 2 of Tutorial), the code instantiates `Net` and saves this with a Variable `net`.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "net = Net()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here is the first of the modification we will make to send the code to the GPU. Luckily this is really easy with PyTorch, all we have to do is add `.to(device)` to our code to accomplish the sending to the GPU.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "net = Net().to(device)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The next change we have to make is inside of the main epcoh loop (Part 4 of the Tutorial). This will be to our data, as we will need to both the inputs and labels to the GPU for training.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Original serial verison\n",
    "inputs, labels = data\n",
    "\n",
    "# GPU support version\n",
    "inputs, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: In the Tutorial in Part 5. It has code the essentially reloads the model from the saved model. This was noted as not necessary, and I did not include that in the code I ran because it is not needed for this model (and make our job harder)\n",
    "\n",
    "When testing our CNN we will need to apply similar changes to send data to the GPU. The first part is when we are only testing a few images (Beginning of Part 5 of tutorial). We will need to grab the few images we are testing and send that to the GPU.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Original serial version\n",
    "dataiter = iter(testloader)\n",
    "images, labels = dataiter.next()\n",

    "images, labels = dataiter.next()\n",
    "images, labels = images.to(device), labels.to(device)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part, a naturally extension of the first part, is testing with all images (Middle of Part 5). This is located in the first for-loop that loops through all of the data. We simply just need to send the data to the GPU again with the following code (that we also used above).\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Original serial version\n",
    "images, labels = data\n",
    "\n",
    "# GPU support version\n",
    "inputs, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, using the same exact process as the second step, but now in the second for-loop looping through all the data that is now checking for accuracy per classification  group (End of Part 5 in tutorial)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Original serial version\n",
    "images, labels = data\n",
    "\n",
    "# GPU support version\n",
    "inputs, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the above steps will create code that is parallelized with 1 GPU. Now to multiple GPUs (which is even easier)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi GPU Parallelize\n",
    "\n",
    "With PyTorch this really could not be any easier. The following will parallelize the code with multi GPU support.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is, in fact, only one change that needs to be made to make this work on multiple GPUs. This occurs when we first instantiate our `Net` class. We simply will just want to pass in our `Net` instantiation into `nn.DataParallel()`. This can be see by the following\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Single GPU support version\n",
    "net = Net().to(device)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple GPU support version\n",
    "net = Net()\n",
    "if gpu_avail > 1:\n",
    "    net = nn.DataParallel(net)\n",
    "net = net.to(device)\n",
    "```\n",
    "What this code does is break apart the instantiation to allow us to pass in `net` into `nn.DataParallel()` only if more than one is GPU is avaliable. Then just like before we send the network to the \"device\". Fortunetly enough, `nn.DataParallel()` is smart enough that it will now handle everying dealing with more than 1 GPU. Even though `device` just refers to cuda, the network will send the right data to the right GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have created code that can actually run in serial if no GPU's are avalible, run with 1 GPU if only one is available, or run with mutliple GPU if multiple GPUs are availiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alterations to code for timing study\n",
    "\n",
    "The timing study I conducted was to see how the time it took to run the model changed across computation types (CPU only, single GPU, multiple GPU) and batch sizes. The accuracy was also recorded and analyzed. The hope was to see if multiple GPU parallelization provides speed up over CPU and single GPU models, and how much changing batch affected time and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will not go too deeply into my code alterations for the timing study as they could be implemented many ways, but I will give a general breakdown of what I did.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Created new python file called `data_load.py` that contains the first couple of lines that download and load the data. I did this because I included this at the beginning of the submissions scripts. So in case if the data was not downloaded, that time of downloading was not included in the timed portion of the test.\n",
    "* Created a way to pass in argument while running script from command line that can change the batch size of the model. I ran my model with 5 different batch sizes `50`,`100`,`150`,`200`,`250` to compare time it took to run model\n",
    "* Altered the dimensions of the CNN in `Net` at the suggestion of the tutorial (found at the end of tutorial). I changed the fist Conv2d to `nn.Conv2d(3, 64, 5)` and the second Conv2d to `self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(64, 16, 5)`\n",
    "> **For reference:** Exercise: Try increasing the width of your network (argument 2 of the first nn.Conv2d, and argument 1 of the second nn.Conv2d – they need to be the same number), see what kind of speedup you get\n",
    "* Changed the number of epochs to `20` with a variable. (If wanted could also make that an argument to pass in).\n",
    "* Finally, I created three different codes for ease of alteration. With each code I changed the output files to be saved in a `output` folder. I also changed the label of all of the outputs to also include the batch size and compute type (`CPU`,`single`,`multi`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the provided code\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run a test of the provided pre-modified code plus submission scripts with a few simple make commands. Each code will run for 20 epochs with a batch size of 250 (should take about 4 min for each). To run the multiple GPU code, make sure you are on a dev node with GPU access that is not `dev-intel14-k20`.\n",
