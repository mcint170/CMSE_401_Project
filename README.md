Semester-long project focused on implementing software onto the HPCC and parallelizing the software to decrease run time.

This folder contains all of the contents for the project.

The project I selected is to implement PyTorch on the HPCC, and Parallalize a Reinforcement Learning Algorithm, made with pytorch, that learns how to beat Super Mario Bros Level 1.

Project Proposal is located in MariOh_Proposal.ipynb

A getexample-esque for PyTorch is located in the pytorch_classifier folder

The Mario Reinforcement Learning Code is located in MariOh

Please note that most of the code written and some documentation comes from these resources.
