Semester-long project focused on implementing software onto the HPCC and parallelizing the software to decrease run time.

This folder contains all of the contents for the project.

The project I selected is to implement PyTorch on the HPCC, and Parallalize with multiple GPUs a Convolutional Neural Network, made with pytorch, that learns how to classify images from CIFAR 10 images.

Original (now outdated and not about this CNN) Project Proposal is located in Project_Proposal.ipynb

A getexample-esque for PyTorch and this CNN is located in the `pytorch_classifier/` folder

The Parallalized CNN classifier code is located in `timing_study/`

Please note that the code used is based of the provided code in the following tutorial
